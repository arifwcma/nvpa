# Requirements
I suggest we circle back to our plans to develop the drought sensitivity/native vegetation performance mapping tool, now that you have the faster computer (and hopefully access to the appropriate programs through Otto).  We can continue to progress funding bids as opportunities arise but it will be a very beneficial piece of work anyway so I’m happy not to wait any longer for additional funding, and just get started.  I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about it again recently and I’m wondering if, rather than trying to blend too many indicators in together for the first step, we could just try creating something catchment wide purely with NDVI/Sentinel 2 and focused on 10m resolution.  The two related outputs would be 1. Time slider for tracking historical trends in vegetation health over the last decade. And 2. classify land into sensitivity zones at 10m resolution, color-coded eg. extremely high (< 0.2 NDVI), high (0.2–0.3), medium (0.3–0.5), low (> 0.5). We can then build layers of complexity on top of this as later steps.
