Hi Chris,

Thank you for your effort in setting up my PC. I just wanted to let you know that I will be away after 3 PM today until 2 September. If I could give it a test run for an hour or so before I leave today, that would give you enough time to fix any potential issues in between.

Hi Arif, cc Nicole,

This is the ticket for new Dell Desktop

I'm noting the list that you provided on here

1. AWS CLI
2. WSL
3. PostGRE SQL Server/Client
4. psycopg2 library: Open “Python Command Prompt” (after installing ArcGIS) and issue the command: conda install -c conda-forge psycopg2
5. SMS (Ag Leader): https://portal.agleader.com/community/s/article/3529?language=en_US (SMS_v25_2_full at the right panel)
6. 7-zip (or anything that can extract .war, .tar.gz)
7. PyCharm
8. Python
9. GIT bash
10. ArcGIS Pro
11. ArcMap
12. QGIS
13. Brother printer installer
14. P-Touch Editor
15. Microsoft PowerToys (at Microsoft Store) Actions that require admin access, and which were previously approved:
16. Add my user (m.rahman) to docker-user group
17. WSL Update
18. First run of Docker desktop (Run docker desktop and continue with the default options until you see it has initiated properly – will require admin access a few times on the way)
19. Add C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\bin to PATH environment variable (“17” can different – say, 17.1 – based on the latest version) New software request The following items have been approved by my supervisor (Joel Boyd):
20. Anaconda
21. CUDA. First check if it is already installed by issuing the command in CMD (nvcc --version) If no version is showed, please follow: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html
22. Android Studio – (keep all default options checked during setup so the Android SDK, Platform Tools, Emulator, and AVD components are installed.)
23. Visual Studio (Only .NET desktop development component is sufficient)
24. Visual Studio Code
25. Unity 3D. First please install Unity Hub. After that, open the program and install the latest Unity3D from there.
26. JetBrains Rider ** Please note that after all the installations, I may need to test everything to ensure it is working properly. I usually need a few passes to get them working on my personal machine, even with full access. We may need to go through a few back-and-forth adjustments to make everything work with just enough privileges without weakening WCMA network security.
